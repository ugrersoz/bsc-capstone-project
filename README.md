[![Research Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Research-BSc%20Capstone-blue)](https://github.com/ugrersoz/bsc-capstone-project)

## Overview 📚
This repository contains the deliverables of my **BSc Capstone Project** completed as part of my undergraduate studies at **Bahçeşehir University (BAU)**, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics. Titled **"Investigation of the Relationship Between CYP1A2 Genotypes, Caffeine Metabolism and Enhanced Sports Performance"**, this research explores a genetic-based approach to optimize caffeine consumption practices for a healthy sports lifestyle among university students and young-adult Turkish populations. The project was conducted under the supervision of senior faculty and reflects my expertise in genetic analysis and bioinformatics. 🎓

## Project Description 🌟
This study investigates the correlation between **CYP1A2 gene variants**, caffeine metabolism, and sports performance enhancement. Caffeine is known to improve athletic performance by reducing fatigue, increasing focus, and enhancing endurance. However, individual responses to caffeine vary due to genetic differences in the CYP1A2 gene region. The research leverages global studies and the **1000 Genomes Project** genetic data, combined with a survey of Turkish participants, to visualize and analyze these relationships. Key objectives include:
- Raising awareness about the CYP1A2 gene and its role in caffeine metabolism.
- Promoting genetics-based nutritional practices, starting with caffeine-containing foods.
- Encouraging genetic studies for both sedentary and professional individuals in the Turkish population.

## Research Highlights 🔬
- Analyzes the impact of CYP1A2 genotypes on caffeine metabolism and sports performance.
- Utilizes data from the 1000 Genomes Project and a custom survey for empirical validation.
- Aims to provide actionable insights for personalized nutrition and sports training.
- Demonstrates proficiency in genetic data analysis and Jupyter Notebook-based visualization.

## Files 📂
